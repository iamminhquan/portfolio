Commit Message Rules

Follow these rules strictly when generating commit messages.

Format:
<type>: <short description>

Rules:
- Maximum 72 characters total
- Single line only
- No trailers (no co-author lines)
- No multi-line explanations
- No emojis
- No AI-style formal wording
- Write like a developer leaving notes to their future self
- Focus on WHAT changed, not WHY in detail
- Use direct verbs (add, move, split, remove, fix, clean, update)

Allowed commit types:
feat      → new feature
fix       → bug fix
refactor  → structure change without behavior change
chore     → maintenance / cleanup / config
docs      → documentation only
style     → formatting or lint-only changes

Good examples:
refactor: split scene into modular components
chore: clean up unused imports
feat: add contact section
docs: update project structure in README
fix: correct scroll interpolation bug

Bad examples:
❌ long explanations
❌ multi-line commits
❌ AI-generated formal summaries
❌ co-author trailers
❌ vague messages like "update code"

Commit messages must be short, human, and easy to read months later.
